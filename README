Simple to use:
python3 d2v.py /etc/systemd/system/some-service.service /path/ouput

2 files will be in the output, one is the SysVinit script and the other is an explanation file for manually setups if needed...
Assume: groups ,dependencies, etc... 

You can see the simple and complex service files and check the ouput with the same name...
